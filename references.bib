Two possibilities are there to communicate nodes; either node can communicate directly or by forwarding network traffic through intermediate nodes in wireless adhoc network. Various types of attacks can undoubtedly be accomplished by an opponent either by passing MAC layer protocol or sending Radio Signals. Reviewing the role of wireless adversary, which victims the packets of high importance and do not follow network architecture. Attacker will make possible efforts of making users not to use network resources and fail the communication. The authors believe that detecting Jamming Attack using Reactive Jammers is quite difficult. Our Proposed approach about Global Detection of Jamming is helpful in securing other nodes from Jammer’s Activity by broadcasting Jammer’s UID. For mitigation, our approach named ARC (Anti-Reactive Control) Technique which shows that Jamming Attack against Reactive Jammer can be detected using decreasing PDR and RSS values and successfully mitigated by executing channel hopping. Using NS3 simulation, the attack can be identified through the decreased in performance criteria and successfully mitigated by executing channel hopping. We have analyzed the result using NS3 Wireless Jamming Module.},

	abstract = {A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a group of several wireless mobile nodes, that communicate with each other without requiring any pre-existing infrastructure, forming an arbitrary topology and there is no centralized administration present. In wireless MANET, each mobile node can act as a receiver and a router and they are free to move randomly. Because of the dynamic topology of the MANETs, routing is one of the crucial issues in these network structures. Routing protocols help in setting up communication between mobile nodes and they also affect the performance of the network. A variety of routing protocols have been designed for MANET. This paper shows design and performance analysis of Mobile Ad hoc Networks, using the reactive routing protocols like AODV which is Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector and AOMDV which is Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector. The simulation is performed using the network simulation software NS2.},

	abstract = {A wireless ad hoc network is a collection of wireless nodes that can dynamically self-organize into an arbitrary and temporary topology to form a network without necessarily using any pre-existing infrastructure. These characteristics make ad hoc networks well suited for military activities, emergency operations, and disaster recoveries. Nevertheless, as electronic devices are getting smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, the mobile market is rapidly growing and, as a consequence, the need of seamlessly internetworking people and devices becomes mandatory. New wireless technologies enable easy deployment of commercial applications for ad hoc networks. The design of an ad hoc network has to take into account several interesting and difficult problems due to noisy, limited-range, and insecure wireless transmissions added to mobility and energy constraints. This paper presents an overview of issues related to medium access control (MAC), routing, and transport in wireless ad hoc networks and techniques proposed to improve the performance of protocols. Research activities and problems requiring further work are also presented. Finally, the paper presents a project concerning an ad hoc network to easily deploy Internet services on low-income habitations fostering digital inclusion.},

Although several proposals are available for reducing power consumption for intra-piconet communication, none of them addresses the utilization of the Park mode to reduce power consumption together with the support of a large number of accessible devices. This ongoing research work bridges that gap by proposing polling based on the probability of service access for a centralized Bluetooth network of resource-constraint devices. Services of connected devices (slaves) are offered to the central device (master) which manages all communications in the network. The slaves remain in Park mode unless their services are accessed by the master. This research work shows the feasibility of our proposal.},
